Answer: Egg


Millenias ago there was a chicken-like bird. It was genetically close to a 
chicken but wasn't a chicken. Also called it a proto-chicken. 
Proto-hen laid an egg, and proto-rooster fertilized it. But when the genes 
from the mother and father proto-chicken fused, they combined in a new way, 
creating a mutation that accidentally made the baby different from its parents.
That egg was different enough to become the official progenitor of a new 
species, now known as the chicken! So, two birds that weren't really chickens 
created a chicken egg, and hence, we have an answer: The egg came first, 
and then it hatched a chicken.
