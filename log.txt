The red junglefowl is known to be the progenitor of the chicken. The first chicken was domesticated from them by humans about 8000-10000 years ago. 
We used chicken on food, agriculture and entertainment. As chickens became increasingly a scope of demand as a delicacy, we indulged them in countless
cross-breeding and artificial changes to their genes to have them produce more eggs during gestation. Meaning that the chickens from 8000 years ago are
genetically nowhere close to modern day chickens. The question presumably refers to the origin of modern day chickens, that is, today’s chicken.
Hence the current chicken is, for now, at the most desirable form. Tomorrow’s chicken might be different, and more ideal than today’s and that chicken’s 
birth was made possible because of an egg from today’s chicken, and of course human intervention.
