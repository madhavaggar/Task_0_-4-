Explanation
Evolutionary evidence says that the first eggs existed much before the "first chicken" existed, 
but those eggs are not "chicken eggs".Chicken eggs certainly came after chickens,because the protein required to form 
the hard egg shell was present only in the ovary of chicken.It is claimed that the first true chicken came from 
the mating two proto-chickens(almost -chickens).
Since the question was EGG or CHICKEN and not CHICKEN EGG,i opted for EGG.
