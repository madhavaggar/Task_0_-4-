As the question pertains to "chicken" eggs and not eggs in general, the answer
is the egg came first. This is because the first "chicken" must have hatched from 
the first "chicken" egg eventhough the "thing" that laid it might not exactly be considered
a "chicken".

Whatever be the case, at the end of the day, its a causality dilemma and a scenario of closed
infinte regress...so...¯\_(ツ)_/¯
